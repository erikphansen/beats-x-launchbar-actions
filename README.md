# BeatsX LaunchBar Actions

A couple of simple actions to connect and disconnect my BeatsX headphones to and from my Mac using LaunchBar. Because digging through the Bluetooth menu manually makes me sad.

Feel free to use this for your own headphones. But you'll need to adjust each action's AppleScript file, unless your headphones also happen to be named `Erik Hansenâ€™s BeatsX`.
